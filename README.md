# CareFinder: Mapping Canadian Healthcare Facilities 

### Project Summary:
CareFinder is a specialized web-based platform that enables users across
Canada to locate healthcare facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes,
and ambulatory health services, with ease. Key features include an
interactive map with search and filter options, detailed facility profiles, and
an adaptable interface with dark mode for visual clarity. Users can filter
facilities by location, type, and services, explore detailed information about
each facility, and view the distribution of facilities across Canada.


#### Problem Statement and Motivation:
While general map services like Google Maps offer basic location
information, CareFinder is uniquely tailored to address the healthcare
needs of Canadian residents, immigrants, healthcare professionals,
caregivers, and tourists seeking medical facilities. The motivation behind
CareFinder is to provide a focused, efficient tool for finding healthcare
services by specific criteria such as facility type and specialized services—
details often buried or inconsistent in broader mapping platforms.
CareFinder solves the problem of healthcare access by providing an
organized, filterable, and user-friendly interface dedicated solely to
healthcare, empowering users to make informed choices about the
facilities that meet their needs.
